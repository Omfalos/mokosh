# Known Issues & Actionable Fixes

Findings from a full MCP tool audit and AI/senior/staff engineering assessment (2026-06-13).

---

## P2 — Usability / reliability

### 5. Stale graph cache has no detection or warning

**File:** `src/mcp/cache.ts`, all query handlers

**Symptom:** Editing source files mid-session then querying `get_affected` or `get_dependencies` returns silently stale results. There is no indication the graph is out of date. A misremembered `clear_cache` call produces confidently wrong answers.

**Fix:**
- Include `graphBuiltAt` (ISO timestamp) in every query response so callers can judge staleness.
- On each tool call, spot-check `mtime` of 5–10 randomly sampled nodes against the filesystem; if any differ, add `"warning": "graph may be stale — call clear_cache if source files changed"` to the response.

### 6. `propose_tags` output volume is unusable

**File:** `src/mcp/handlers.ts:292–301`, `src/tags/proposer.ts`

**Symptom:** With a large diff (the current branch), `propose_tags` returns 120+ tags. Neither an AI assistant nor a CI system can act on this — the hard part (ranking) is left to the consumer.

**Fix:**
- Add a `topTags` field (top 10) ranked by coverage: tags that cover the most changed files via the shortest graph path rank highest.
- Make `topTags` the primary output; keep the full list under `allTags` for completeness.
- Add a `limit` parameter so callers can cap the response.

---

### 7. Workspace tool error does not explain the `entryPoints: []` requirement

**File:** `src/mcp/cache.ts` (`requireWorkspace`), `src/mcp/handlers.ts:394–425`

**Symptom:** Calling `get_workspace_packages` or `get_workspace_affected` after `analyze` with explicit entry points errors with `"No workspace graph cached for this root. Call 'analyze' first."` — which is technically true but completely unhelpful. The user already called `analyze`.

**Fix:**
- In `requireWorkspace`, detect that a single-package graph (not a workspace graph) is cached for `root` and return: `"Single-package graph found. Call analyze with entryPoints: [] to trigger monorepo auto-detection."`.
- In the `analyze` response when entry points are provided, include `"workspaceFeaturesAvailable": false` as a hint.

---

### 8. `find_uncovered` `null` entries pollute the uncovered list (same root as #4, separate fix)

**File:** `src/mcp/handlers.ts:279`

```ts
// Current — wrong
.filter((n) => (n.coveragePct ?? 0) < threshold)

// Fix
.filter((n) => n.coveragePct !== null && n.coveragePct !== undefined && n.coveragePct < threshold)
```

Separate ticket from #4 because it is a one-line fix independent of the early-return behaviour.

---

## P3 — Strategic gaps

### 9. No CI integration story for `propose_affected_tests`

**Symptom:** The tool returns a file path list but there is no documented or CLI-supported path to a test runner invocation. Users must wire it manually every time.

**Fix:**
- Add `--format vitest` / `--format jest` / `--format raw` to the CLI's `--affected-tests` command to emit a ready-to-run shell snippet.
- Add a GitHub Actions example to `docs/usage.md` showing the full `mokosh → vitest` pipeline.

---

### 10. Call edge coverage limitations are undocumented

**Symptom:** Users calling `get_callers` or `get_call_graph` and receiving empty results have no way to know whether "0 callers" means the truth or a data gap (class methods, callbacks, dynamic dispatch).

**Fix (even before #1 is fully resolved):**
- Add to the `get_callers` and `get_call_graph` tool descriptions: `"Call edges are extracted only from top-level exported functions. Class methods, nested functions, and callbacks are not tracked."`
- After fixing #1, update the caveat to reflect remaining limitations (callbacks, dynamic dispatch).

---

### 11. `analyze` with empty `entryPoints` on a non-monorepo falls through silently

**File:** `src/mcp/handlers.ts:115–131`

**Symptom:** On a non-monorepo project, `analyze` with `entryPoints: []` detects `layout.type === "none"` and falls through to build a graph with zero entry points — which results in only test files being included. No error or warning is returned.

**Fix:**
- When `entryPoints` is empty and no monorepo is detected, return an error: `"No monorepo detected and no entry points provided. Pass at least one entry point (e.g. ['src/index.ts'])."`.

## P0 — Pre-publish blockers (architect review, 2026-06-15)

### 12. Public API surface leaks all internals via `export *` — ✅ Resolved

**File:** `src/index.ts`

**Was:** `export * from "./graph"` and `export * from "./parser"` mass-re-exported every internal type and function.

**Fixed:** `src/index.ts` now uses explicit named exports only — no `export *` anywhere. Each symbol is intentionally surfaced.

---

### 13. Go local-resolution — ✅ Resolved (2026-06-19)

**File:** `src/graph/lang-resolvers/go.ts`

**Was:** The Go parser marked all imports as external. No local edges appeared in the graph.

**Fixed:** Pure filesystem resolution via `go.mod` parsing (see ADR-007):
- All non-test `.go` files in the target package directory are returned as edges (one edge per file), accurately reflecting Go's package-scoped import model.
- `replace` directives (block and single-line form, including version-constrained LHS) are parsed and applied before standard module-prefix resolution.

**Remaining known limitations** (documented in ADR-007; vendor and workspace support deferred):
- `vendor/` directories: third-party packages stored under `vendor/` are still treated as external.
- `go.work` workspaces: multi-module workspace files are not read.

---

### 14. Consolidate overlapping MCP tools — ✅ Resolved (2026-06-19)

**File:** `src/mcp/tools.ts`, `src/mcp/handlers.ts`

**Was:** `get_affected` and `get_change_impact` did the same traversal with different caching strategies. `propose_tags` and `propose_affected_tests` ran the same graph walk and differed only in output format. 20 tools before v1.

**Fixed:**
- Merged `get_change_impact` into `get_affected` via `cached: boolean` parameter (default `false`).
- Merged `propose_affected_tests` into `propose_tags` via `format: "tags" | "paths"` parameter (default `"tags"`).
- Tool count reduced from 20 to 18.

---

### 15. Stale cache has no query-time detection — ✅ Resolved (2026-06-19)

Already tracked as **#5** above — promoted to P0 because it produces wrong answers silently, which is the highest-risk failure mode for an AI-facing tool.

**Fixed:** File-watcher auto-refresh via `node:fs` (no new dependencies):
- `analyze` starts an `fs.watch({ recursive: true })` listener on the project root (ignoring `node_modules`, `.git`, `dist`, `build`, `coverage`).
- Any source file change marks the root as dirty in `SessionState`.
- Every query handler calls `cache.ensureFresh()` / `cache.ensureFreshWorkspace()` instead of `cache.require()` — if dirty, an incremental rebuild runs transparently before answering.
- `clear_cache` still works for manual invalidation; the watcher survives it (session-scoped, not cache-scoped).
- `startWatching()` is idempotent — safe to call on re-analyze.

---

### 16. No positioning statement — ✅ Resolved (2026-06-19)

**File:** `README.md`, `docs/prd.md`

**Was:** The README had no "Why Mokosh?" section. The PRD described Mokosh as a "frontend-focused" tool despite supporting 10+ languages.

**Fixed:**
- Added "Why Mokosh?" section to the README: local-first, offline, MCP integration, multi-language, AI-ready output, no vendor lock-in.
- Updated PRD product overview and problem statement to reflect the actual multi-language, local-first scope.
